Integration tests
Mostly testing the whole pipeline from raw data to each output format.


You have implemented changes that make the tests fail due to correcting a bug?

1. Check all failing tests:
Check each failing test thoroughly to make sure that only the desired changes are present and
not any undesired side effects. Tip: Some IDEÂ´s like PyCharm offer file comparisons (PyCharm: Click
both files via "Strg" and then right click "compare files"). To generate the output file
corresponding to your changes use the below approach.

2. Update the corresponding test files:
Set a debug point on the teardown function of the respective test and let it run. The debug
avoids that the results are deleted within the teardown function. Now copy the CORRECT result files
to the tests folder under the respective test (tests/test_files/regular_tests).
