# AixWeather
**A weather data generation tool for building energy system simulations. Pull, Transform, Export.**

It is being developed at RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, 
Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) in Aachen, Germany.

As the library is developed at RWTH Aachen University's EBC, the library's name AixWeather is derived from the 
city's French name Aix-la-Chapelle, which the people of Aachen are very fond of and use a lot. 
With the name AixWeather we follow this local tradition.

If you have any questions regarding AixWeather, feel free to contact us at aixweather@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.

## WebApp

For fast access without setup, use the WebApp.
The repository [AixWeather-WebApp](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixWeather-WebApp) contains the corresponding WebApp for this repo.
This repository contains the functionalities useful for, e.g., automation of tasks. 

## How to use
For each data origin, a class is defined. Use generic functions to create the desired output file.
See the examples to know how to use them.  

## Tool structure and overview

**This tool consists of three layers:**

1. Import raw weather data from several sources

2. Transform the weather data to a defined core format with consideration of:

    2.1. Time zone

    2.2. Time of measurement (whether a value at a certain time stamp is for the indicated time or, e.g., the average of the preceding hour)

    2.3. Avoidance of smoothing through interpolation (pass through variables without interpolation if possible)

    2.4. Units

    2.5. Calculate missing variables from available ones, e.g., horizontal direct radiation from diffuse and global radiation

    2.6. Missing data.

3. Transform the core-format data to your desired output format

**Overview**

**Known limitations:**

- only hourly data

**Chances:**

- generic code base that allows for fast and easy extensions to both other import formats and output formats


# DWD station IDs and DWD MOSMIX station IDs

The station IDs for the DWD weather stations to pull historical data from are listed [here](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/klimadatendeutschland/statliste/statlex_rich.txt;jsessionid=68E14BA255FE50BDC4AD9FF4F835895F.live31092?view=nasPublication&nn=16102). Only german stations available. Aachen would be 15000.

The DWD MOSMIX station IDs for the DWD forecast are listed [here](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/met_verfahren_mosmix/mosmix_stationskatalog.cfg?view=nasPublication&nn=16102) or located on a map [here](https://wettwarn.de/mosmix/mosmix.html). Worldwide station available. Aachen would be 10505.

You may use the imported package [Wetterdienst](https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst) to search for stations automatically, as described [here](https://bookdown.org/brry/rdwd/station-selection.html).


# Sources of information for corresponding data formats

## Input

**Test Reference Years (TRY)**: 

[Handbuch](https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/forschung/programme/zb/Auftragsforschung/5EnergieKlimaBauen/2013/testreferenzjahre/try-handbuch.pdf). 

TRY data can be downloaded from the DWD (sign up required but for free) [TRY data sets](https://www.bbsr.bund.de/BBSR/DE/forschung/programme/zb/Auftragsforschung/5EnergieKlimaBauen/2013/testreferenzjahre/01-start.html;jsessionid=5D9912D230EB887C1F831671303A8A0F.live21304?nn=2544408&pos=2). 

Additional information on the suitability of TRY data (last update: 2019):
There are typical TRY datasets grouped by the year of publication:
- 2004 datasets: (DWD; some errors in solar radiation; dataset should be avoided).
- 2010 datasets: suitable for EnEV and GEG, not for solar thermal simulations.
- 2015 datasets: not suitable for EnEV and GEG, but for solar thermal simulations
- Overall: Reliable quantities in TRYs are only the air temperature
and the global radiation!

**DWD forecasts (MOSMIX i.e. KML files)**: [open data website](https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/) go to content.log.bz2.

**EnergyPlus (EPW)**: 

For format information, see the corresponding output format description. 

Online sources for EPW data: https://climate.onebuilding.org/default.html and https://www.ladybug.tools/epwmap/

**ERC data:**

This data is from the weather station of the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (RWTH). Access requires user credentials. Such credentials are pre-defined if you use the WebApp.

## Output formats

**EnergyPlus (EPW):**

[3rd party format description](https://designbuilder.co.uk/cahelp/Content/EnergyPlusWeatherFileFormat.htm)

**Modelica ReaderTMY3:**

TMY3 reader from the [IBPSA](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica-ibpsa) library used in the [AixLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) library. Model info at [OpenModelica](https://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Buildings.BoundaryConditions.WeatherData.ReaderTMY3.html).
It claims to use mainly [TMY3 data](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf), though we found that the pressure is used in mbar instead of Pa. Further deviations possible.

Additional information for AixLib users.

Weather data usage in the low order model (LOM):

Used in LOM:
- TDryBul
- RelHum
- TBlaSky (calculated via HInfHor, TDryBul, TDewPoi, and OpaSkyCov)
- HGloHor
- HDifHor
- HDirNor

Not used in the LOM:
- total sky cover
- ceiling height
- wind direction
- wind speed
- atmospheric pressure

**Unconverted to x**

exports the core data without conversion to .csv, .json, or .pickle files.
